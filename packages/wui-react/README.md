> 📋 **Part of [Wui Design](../../README.md)** - A comprehensive design system for any react application

A modern, accessible, and customizable UI kit built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and based on shadcn/ui components. Perfect for building consistent user interfaces across Next.js and React applications.

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 **Modern Design**: Beautiful, clean, and consistent components
- 🎯 **Accessibility First**: Built with accessibility in mind using Radix UI primitives
- 🔧 **Fully Customizable**: Easy to customize with CSS variables and Tailwind utilities
- 📦 **Tree Shakable**: Only import what you need
- 🎭 **Dark Mode Ready**: Built-in dark mode support
- 📚 **Storybook Integration**: Interactive component documentation
- 🧪 **Well Tested**: Comprehensive test coverage with Vitest
- 🔒 **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript support with proper type definitions

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pnpm add @wui.design/wui-react
```

### Setup

**Import the CSS in your app:**

```tsx
// In your main app file (e.g., _app.tsx for Next.js or main.tsx for React)
import "@wui.design/wui-react/styles";
```

**For themed versions, import a specific theme:**

```tsx
// Themes
import "@wui.design/wui-react/themes/theme-1";
import "@wui.design/wui-react/themes/theme-2";
```

> 💡 **Note**: Import only one theme at a time. Themes include all necessary base styles, so you don't need to import both `styles` and a theme.

That's it! The library comes with pre-built CSS, so no additional Tailwind configuration is needed.

## 🎭 Dark Mode

The UI kit supports dark mode out of the box. Simply add the `dark` class to your root element:

```tsx
// Toggle dark mode
document.documentElement.classList.toggle("dark");
```
